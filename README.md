How to get out of this dungeon with impossible puzzles?

Simple. With a magical lantern.

At the moment we're unsure whether this lantern's power is based on time travel. We'll keep you posted. In the meantime, try your best to escape.

The lantern will allow you to create clones of yourself. If that sounds random, it's because it is.
